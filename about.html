## About

Project manager, software engineer and consultant with a background in software architecture, search, and automation.
I enjoy working at the intersection of people, processes, and technology - translating complex needs into clear, practical solutions.
Over the years, I led projects across industries, always guided by the KISS principle. I believe in thoughtful design, straightforward communication, and technology that truly helps people get things done.
